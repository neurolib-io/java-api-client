/**
 * Based on user's past interactions (purchases, ratings, etc.) with the items, recommends top-N items that are most likely to be of high value for a given user.
 * The most typical use cases are recommendations at homepage, in some "Picked just for you" section or in email.
 * The returned items are sorted by relevance (first item being the most relevant).
 * Besides the recommended items, also a unique `recommId` is returned in the response. It can be used to:
 * - Let Neurolib know that this recommendation was successful (e.g. user clicked one of the recommended items). See [Reported metrics](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/admin_ui.html#reported-metrics).
 * - Get subsequent recommended items when the user scrolls down (*infinite scroll*) or goes to the next page. See [Recommend Next Items](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/api.html#recommend-next-items).
 * It is also possible to use POST HTTP method (for example in case of very long ReQL filter) - query parameters then become body parameters.
